This is a sample project that includes a login page and simple functionalities.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate security mechanisms and prevent common attacks like SQL injection and XSS.

Many security aspects are not considered here since the scope of this project is local and does not involve network communication (server side, etc...).

In order to run this project, make sure to adjust the DB_cred.txt file properly.

This project was built as a final project for a university course.(small scope).



If you find any vulnarabilities in the project I would love to check them out.
Thanks.
